# Simple Chat Server


In this project I used [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn server`

Runs the server in the development mode.
The server will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn start`

Runs the server in the production mode!
